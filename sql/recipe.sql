(6, 'Braised Brussels Sprouts with Bacon', 'Bring a large pot of water to a boil, ideally with a large mesh frying basket inside to pull your sprouts from the water. Trim off the bottom 1/8 inch or so of each sprout, and peel off the outer 2-3 leaves from each sprout--- these are too tough to eat. Cut about four slices of bacon into 1/2" strips. Take a large cast iron pan (eg. 14") or a heavy-bottom braising pan and place over medium heat. Brown the bacon in the pan, removing when its just crisp. Reserve in a bowl. Leave the drippings in the pan, and turn on high. Fill a very large bowl with ice and cold water and put in your sink. You''ll use this to shock the sprouts after briefly cooking them in boiling water. Once the water has come to a boil, place the sprouts in the water or in the basket. Cook until almost tender, but still very firm, about 3-4 minutes. Cut one in half to test firmness, and bite into it. It should still taste a little raw. Pull the sprouts from the water, e.g, in your basket, and immerse in your ice bath, for a few minutes, until cold. Drain well and towel off. Turn the heat on the cast iron pan to high. When the pan starts to smoke, gently toss the sprouts in the pan, trying to get as little water in the pan as possible. Toss in the pan well, to even coat with oil-- you should get some nice blackening on some parts of the sprouts. Cook for 2-3 minutes over high heat. Add chicken stock to the pan and reduce, for a few minutes until the sprouts are firm but tasting like they are done and the stock is reduced till there are a few tablespoons left-- it should start to thicken up a bit, forming an emulsion with the bacon drippings. Finish with 1 Tablespoon EVO and salt and pepper.\r\n', 15, 15, 2104),
(7, 'Braised Shortribs', 'Debone the shortribs if needed, cutting them into approximately 1.5 inch cubes. These will be very well marbled, even fatty pieces of meat. Trim off excess silver-skin and large external pieces of meat. To brown the meat, first coat all sides with an even sprinkling of black pepper and kosher salt. Heat a large cast iron pan over high heat for several minutes, until starting to smoke. Add 1 Tbs of canola oil. Working in batches that fit inside the frying pan, brown the meat on all sides, then put on a sheet pan lined with paper towels to rest. For additional batches, you won''t need more oil because the fat from the ribs will accumulate in the pan. Wet and wring out a large enough pieces of cheese cloth to extend beyond the sides of the Dutch oven you''ll use for the meat. You need a dutch oven large enough to hold the meat in 1-2 layers, ideally 1. Use the same one you made the red wine reduction in, if possible. Add the sliced carrots, diced onions, and parsley sprigs to the red wine reduction in the dutch oven. Then cover with the cheese cloth, to create a nest for the meat. Gently place the meat in the cheesecloth nest, and cover the meat with the cloth. Add enough beef or veal stock to cover the meat. Your meat should still be covered nicely by the cheese cloth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then cover and place in 350 degree oven for about 2 hours until the meat is extremely tender. Once the meat is done, remove the cheese cloth nest with meat enclosed, allow meat to rest in a large bowl or sheet pan. Scoop out the large solids from the remaining sauce and then strain in a chinois. In a heatproof container, place the meat and cover with the sauce, so the meat is covered. Allow to cool, cover and refrigerate for 1-3 days. This allows the sauce to permeate meat. On serving day prepare your vegetables. Peel and trim the carrots as needed. Cut fingerlings in half lengthwise if they are much bigger than your thumb. Cut the tops and bottoms from the pearl onions. Heat about 1/2 gallon of water to a boil, add some garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf for flavoring. Blanch the carrots and then the fingerling potatoes in this water, til still firm, and then shock in ice water. For pearl onions, cook for about 10 minutes in the boiling water mixture, then shock in ice water. Then, you''ll need to peel the skin from them-- I make a cut lengthwise through the outer layer of skin, and then peel the onion. Slice the button mushrooms, and saute in a hot cast iron pan with butter until browned and cooked. Slice the bacon into 1/2 pieces, and roast on a sheet pan in 350 oven till just crisp. Drain and let cool. To serve, take the beef and sauce mixture out of the refrigerator a few hours ahead of time to bring to room temperature, Carefully scoop the meat out and reserve. Place the sauce in a heavy bottom sauce pot or dutch oven, and reduce to a few cups over high heat. Add the meat back in, and the cooked vegetables. Check seasonings, adding salt and pepper as needed. Add a few tablespoons of chopped parsely. Warm the bacon in the oven. Serve in warm shallow bowls, topped with a few bits of bacon and a touch of chopped parsley.\r\n\r\n', 180, 180, 327),
(8, 'Brine', 'Zest the lemons with a vegetable peeler, and then juice them. Combine zest and juice with all other ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil. Let cool before you put your meat into it. This recipe is enough brine for 2 chickens @ 2.5 pounds.\r\n', 10, 15, 2422),
(9, 'Broccoli Raab Pasta', 'Bring a large pot of liberally salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, wash and chop your broccoli raab, chopping into approximately 3/4 inch pieces. When your water reaches a rolling boil, dump in the broccoli raab. Cook until tender. Start the sausage cooking as the broccoli raab cooks. Remove casing from the sausage and discard. Cook the sausage over medium heat, in a heavy-bottomed pot, e.g, a Le Creuset enameled cast iron pot. Break up the sausage into pieces with a wooden spatula, as it cooks. Cook till done. When the broccoli raab is very tender, fish it out with a netted spoon, and place in the pot with the sausage. Cook over medium heat, breaking up the raab as much as you can. You want the raab to be falling apart by the time you add your pasta. Let the water reach a boil again, and then add the orechiette. Cook for about 5-8 minutes, but still very firm. It will cook more in the sausage pot. Transfer the pasta to the sausage and broccoli raab pot, stirring constantly over medium heat. Gradually add the chicken stock, to create a sauce to hold the pasta and broccoli together. When the pasta is cooked, at the grated parmigiano, salt and pepper to taste, and serve in shallow bowls.\r\n', 15, 15, 2423),
(10, 'Butternut Squash Risotto', 'Pre-heat oven to 450 degress. Peel the butternut squash, then cut in half length wise. Scrape the seeds and surrounding goo with a spoon and discard. Chop the squash into 3/4-inch squares. Season with salt and pepper, and add about 2 TBS olive oil. Spread onto two half-sheet pans. Roast in oven for about 20 minutes total, turnign the squash cubes with a spatula about half way through cooking to brown more than one side. Keep warm while making your risotto. Heat your stock in a pan, and keep it simmering while making the risotto. For the risotto, soften the onion in 2 TBS of EVO over medium heat, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, stirring for about 30 seconds. Add rice and stir for about 30 seconds to coat with oil. Hit it with some white wine to stop the cooking. Add about 3/4 to 1 cup of hot stock at a time to the risotto. Stir over medium to high heat, until about half of the new stock evaporates. Repeat until risotto is almost tender. Add a final 3/4 cup of stock, stir, then add cheese and 1 TBS EVO and 2 TBS butter. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed. Add about 3/4 of the warmed butternut squash to the risotto, incorporating gently with a large spoon. Serve in hot bowls, topping with reserved cubes of squash and additional grated cheese.\r\n', 15, 45, 905),
(11, 'Cajun Roux', 'Pronounced "roo", Roux is traditionally an equal blend of Flour and Oil. Used as the base for many Cajun and Creole recipes. Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet on medium. Beginners should start on medium low until you''re successful with not burning it and creating small pieces of black bits of flour, yuck! Once the oil is hot, add flour and begin stirring slowly and constantly since Roux has a tendancy to burn quickly. (some smoke is normal since you are technically slowly burning and darkening the flour with hot oil) Never stop stirring. If the Cajun Roux sits in one spot for too long, it will burn. If your roux burns, toss it out and start over. A light roux should be the color of a Manila Folder with a slight brownish tint beyond the white color of flour. A dark roux (Traditional) should be the color of saddle leather brown, which can take up to 20 mins.\r\n', 1, 20, 2424),
(12, 'Capcay', NULL, NULL, NULL, 792),
(13, 'Chocolate Chip Cookies', 'Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Beat together butter and sugars in a large bowl with a stand mixer (e.g., KitchenAid) at the highest speed for about 10 minutes. Break your eggs into a bowl and add them to the butter sugar mixture, and turn your mixer onto low speed, and then medium speed after the eggs get incorporated. Beat in the vanilla with the mixer. Add your flour a cp at a time, turning off the mixer and lower the bowl, when you add it. Turn it on low each time you add the flour, so the flour doesn''t fly out of the bowl. You want the mixer to just barely incorporate the flour. Don''t overmix, or else you''ll develop the gluten in the flour, making the cookies doughy. With a large rubber food scraper, incorporate your nuts and chips, a bit at a time. Measure out a bunch of sheets of parchment paper for your sheet pans, or use a silpat. Scoop about 1/4 cup of the batter for each cookie, form into a largish golf ball with your hands, arranging 8 per sheet, in a 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 pattern from top to bottom, to maximize distance between the cookies. Sprinkle a few crystals of course sea salt (fleur de sel if you have it) on each mound. Then, flatten each mound just a little with a barely moistened palm. Bake, 1 sheet at a time until golden, about 12 minutes. Turn the sheet pan 180 degrees about 6 minutes into the bake, for even cooking. Remove from oven when done, let sheet pan sit on a cooling rack for about 2-3 minutes so cookies can cool slightly. Then, with a metal spatula, transfer cookies to the cooling rack and allow to cool. While the cookies are baking, form the mounds for your other sheet pans. It''s better if you don''t re-use the sheet pan for this bake, because you want it to be at room temp when you add the cookie mounds to it, else the mounds will melt and you will be sad.\r\n', 30, 60, 2322),
(14, 'Chocolate Covered Peanut Butter Balls', 'Combine peanut butter, sifted powdered sugar, and peanut butter in a large mixing bowl. Use a Kitchen-Aid with paddle attachment, if you have one. Form into balls less than 1 inch in diameter. Place in rows on a sheet pan, and put the pan in the freezer for the balls to freeze. Roughly chop 3/4 pound of the chocolate, and finely choped 1/4 pound. Temper your chocolate by heating the roughly chopped 3/4 pound in a pyrex or metal bowl over a pot of simmering water on the stove. When half of the chocolate has melted remove the bowl from the simmering water, and stir until the other half melts. Put back on the heat, bring up to 115 degrees, no more than 120 degrees. Remove from heat. Then add the finely chopped portion, stir until the chocolate cools to 82 degrees, stirring constantly with a rubber food scraper. Working quickly so your chocolate temperature doesn''t drop below xx, dip each peanut butter ball in the chocolate then roll immediately in the chopped peanuts. Place in paper cups. If the chocolate starts to harden in the bowl, put the bowl back over the simmering water, melt the chocolate, then remove from heat, and stir until the chocolate reaches 82 degrees.\r\n', 120, 60, 1967),
(15, 'Country Sourdough Bread', 'Feed your starter 2-3x per day for 1-2 days prior to mixing. I use about a 2x build, each time, with the last feed about 9 hours before mixing. I think anywhere between 5-9 hours works. 11 oz of flour, 11 oz of 69 degree water. If you''ve been using the starter at least weekly, then feeding it twice before you use it will be fine. Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl for your stand mixer, putting the water and sourdough in the bowl before the flour-- otherwise some of the flour might get stuck on the bottom. With the paddle attachment, mix on low speed for 5 minutes. Rest for 10 minutes to allow glutens to relax and salt to dissolve. While the dough is resting, switch to the dough hooks. Mix for about 5-10 minutes on medium speed with the paddle attachment-- and the dough should look very stretchy, and start to cling to the paddle. Once the dough has firmed up enough that it no longer clings to the sides of the bowl, you''ll need to hold the mixer down. Start mixing on highest speed for 3-5 minutes more. It should be a fairly solid mass before you take it out of the mixer. You want the glutens to develop as much as possible to make it easier to shape the dough and to give the dough enough oven spring to rise in the oven. Dough should be extremely stretchy and satiny. You should be able to pull it thin so you can just about see through it. Wet your hands while doing this, so the dough doesn''t stick. Your dough temperature should be about 78 degrees. That''s what you''re aiming for. Put the dough into an oiled bowl or rectangular container-- it should come out as a single lump, with little to no dough remaining in the mixing bowl. Cover with a lid and let rise for 3 hours, at about 78 degrees. I cover with a thick towel to help keep the heat in. Midway through the rise, turn the dough: fold the sides of the dough over onto its center, from all four sides. You will likely need an external heat source to keep the dough that warm. After the turn, I use a heating pad on its lowest setting, covering the dough container with a towel, to keep the heat in. Dump the dough out onto counter, and divide in two. Roughly shape the dough with your bench knife. Use a little white flour to prevent sticking. Cover with couche for 15-20 minutes. Do the final shaping with a rocking motion of your two hands. Invert the boule into a floured banneton-- use whole wheat and semolina flour because of the coarse grains and low glutens. Cover with plastic shower caps (the kind you get from a hotel) and place in your refrigerator at about 40 degrees for about 10 hours. Heat oven to 500 degrees with two pizza stones side by side. Cast iron pans underneath for steaming water. Remove dough from your retarder just before baking. Invert baskets onto floured peel, cut with lame, and slide onto each stone. When both loaves are in oven, pour about 2 cups of boiling water onto one of the cast iron pans, wait 3-5 minutes, then do again in the other pan. After 30 minutes more, turn the loaves 180 degrees to get more even cooking. Remove after about 35-40 minutes, when they are nice and dark and look slightly to almost burnt and sound hollow when tapped. Let cool on racks. Brush off the flour with some kind of firmly bristled brush. Slice and eat with some Irish butter.\r\n', 60, 45, 2425),
(16, 'Crepes', 'In a bowl, beat eggs with a whisk, then beat in the milk. Add the flour and mix well until smooth. Add melted butter, sugar, and salt to the batter and mix well. Consistency should be similar to that of heavy cream. Heat a heavy-bottom crepe pan over medium heat until just starting to smoke, about 5-10 minutes, coat lightly with butter. Spread about 4 ounces of batter in concentric circles with spreading tool. Flip after about 1.5 to minutes, then cook for another minute or two.\r\n', 5, 3, 473),
(17, 'Duck Confit', 'The day before you want to make the duck, prepare the green salt and rub into the duck legs. In your mini-prep, grind the salt, bay leaves, thyme, parsley and pepper corns, until its a bright green salt, all big chunks broken down. Rinse the duck legs in cold water, drain, and pat dry. Use about 1 tablespoon of salt per leg, rubbing into the skin and flesh. Place legs in a pyrex dish large enough to hold them in a single layer, cover tightly with plastic, and refrigerate 24 horurs. Preheat your oven to 190-- use a calibrated oven thermometer to make sure you''ve got the correct temperature. Rise the legs under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Layer them in a single layer in a large ovenproof pot with lid--e.g, a Le Creuset dutch oven. Pour melted fat over the legs so that they are covered. Warm the pot over medium heat to warm the fat, then place in oven for about 10 hours. After 10 hours check to see if the meat is tender and falling off the bone. If not, cook for another 1-2 hours. Let legs cool in the fat. Once cooled, carefully lift with a metal spatula out of the fat and rest on sheet pans. Strain the fat in a fine mesh strainer or chinois. Place legs in a container just big enough to hold in one layer (they will have shrunk while cooking). Cool the fat in the refrigerator in a clear, tall container, so the juices settle as a gel in the bottom. Spoon the fat out, and gently warm in a heavy bottom pan over low heat until just liquified. Spoon the barely fat over the legs, so that none of the meat is exposed. Cover and refrigerate or freeze. You can keep them frozen like this for months, or in the refrigerator for several weeks or few months. To serve, pull the container from the refrigerator or freezer long enough to warm to room temperature. Then, warm the container to 190 degrees in a 190 degree oven, carefully lift the legs from the fat, and sear the legs in a hot skillet, skin side down for a few minutes until the skin is a rich brown color. Serve over lentils, brussells sprouts, or whatever your preparation.\r\n', NULL, NULL, 443),

While it''s still pretty firm, drop peas in the boiling water to cook with the pasta. Add a cup of pasta water to your sauce pan. You are making an emulsion of the water, cream, and butter. Cook the peas and pasta for a minute, then drain both, and add to cream sauce. Over low heat, incorporate the pasta and peas into the cream sauce, using tongs, a spoon, and some flips of the pan.

Once all the foie has been incorporated, add the truffle oil gradually, stirring with the spatula. The mixture should be a hazelnut brown, thickened, and gently bubbling. Your pasta should be finished about now--it should still be very al denete. Drain well and then incorporate gradually into the cream mixture.

Season the inside cavity of the chickens with kosher salt and black pepper. Truss the chickens with butcher''s twine. (See the video on www.chopandstir for the trussing technique). Season all sides of the chicken well with salt and pepper. Place two cast iron pans over high heat. Each pan should be about 10" in diameter. Once the pans start to smoke, add 1 tsp canola oil to each pan. Swirl the oil around by tilting the pan. Place each chicken in its own pan, so that the legs are facing the back of the stove, and the handles of the pan are positioned for you to put the pans in the oven. Sear the chickens over high heat for about 1 minute. Place the pans in the lower third of the oven. Roast for about 40 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted between the thigh and breast reads 155. The meat will continue to cook to about 160, after you remove the bird from the oven, as the heat continues to move inwards from the surface of the chicken. The skin should be a rich brown color, crispy to the touch. Let the chickens rest for about 5 minutes in a warm area, or under heat lamps. Remove the chickens to your cutting board. To each pan, add several sprigs of thyme. Then ladle in about 3/4 cup of hot chicken stock into each one.
